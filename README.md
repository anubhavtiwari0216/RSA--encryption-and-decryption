# RSA--encryption-and-decryption
Practical: -3

PRACTICAL NAME: - RSA encryption and                     decryption.
DEFINITION: -    RSA encryption is the process of converting plain text (readable data) into cipher text (unreadable form) using the receiverâ€™s public key.
It ensures that only the intended receiver (who has the private key) can decrypt and read the data.  
TOOLS: - Online website using.
 STEP 1: - Go to the search bar and search RSA encryption and decryption.
 

STEP 2: - Enter the text on RSA encryption Box then click on the Encrypt.
 

STEP 3: - Open first website Dev Glan RSA
Encryption Decryption & key generator tool online.
 
STEP 4: - Click on the generate RSA pair.
 

STEP 5: - Then click on the Decrypt. The you see the encrypted text in the decrypted output. 
 

STEP 6: - Copy the encrypted output and paste on the RSA Decryption Box.
