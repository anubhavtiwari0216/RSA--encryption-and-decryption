# RSA Encryption-and-Decryption
<h1>Practical: -3</h1>

<h3>PRACTICAL NAME: - RSA encryption and decryption.</h3>

DEFINITION: -    RSA encryption is the process of converting plain text (readable data) into cipher text (unreadable form) using the receiverâ€™s public key.
It ensures that only the intended receiver (who has the private key) can decrypt and read the data.  

### TOOLS: - Online website using.

<h4> STEP 1: - Go to the search bar and search RSA encryption and decryption.</h4>
